ðŸŒ² Forest Fire Risk Mapping
This project analyzes historical forest fire data to predict fire risk based on weather conditions. Early prediction can help prevent wildfires and protect lives and resources.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset Source

Forest Fire Dataset â€“ Kaggle

ðŸ”‘ Key Features
X, Y â†’ Spatial coordinates
month, day â†’ Time of observation
FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI â†’ Fire weather indices
temp, RH, wind, rain â†’ Weather conditions
area â†’ Burned area (ha)
fire â†’ Binary target (fire occurred or not)

âœ… Work Completed

Data Loading & Exploration:
Loaded dataset using Pandas.
Displayed head, info, and descriptive statistics.
Verified no missing values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Univariate analysis: Histograms, count plots, and boxplots for continuous and categorical features.
Bivariate analysis: Scatterplots & boxplots to check relationships between variables and fire occurrence.
Correlation matrix: Visualized correlations among numerical features.
Pairplot: Plotted relationships between numerical variables, colored by fire occurrence.

Data Preprocessing:
Encoded categorical variables (month, day) using one-hot encoding.
Split data into training and testing sets (80/20).
Applied feature scaling with StandardScaler:
fit_transform() on training data
transform() on test data
